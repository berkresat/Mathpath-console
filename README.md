# Mathpath-
Hello, I'll tell you how to make a mathematical solver or scientific stuffs on Python with Kivy-KivyMD libraries that developing mobile application.
I developed Mathpath application that is advanced mathematical solver running on mobile and computer during college year. You can check with type 'Mathpath Console' on Google Play Store.

This page includes a little bit tell about; how I made Mathpath? Which I used libraries and programming language? Just I hope this knowledges helps other students or curious minds.

3- Some errors, bugs and problems. And how may solution these problems?

This is a Mathpath. Actually I'm physics student and "one day, when I’m getting symbolic calculating lesson with Maple software, it was fascinated me. That the time, I knew Python language as basic. In a while later my scientific computing feelings was soar. Immediately I created a little group whose have include physics students. I thought this; we have to create a usefull mathematical tools for all students. But most important is we have to spread this “thrive spirit” our classes. But started a pandemic process after the created group just 2 weeks later. But we went on communicate some friends. In the end, I was code my application called “Mathpath Console” before graduation. Now the application published on Google Play Store"

I used Python language to programming my mathematical application. I know most of people didn't know(or heard) how to programming a mobile application with Python. General belief is coding with Python analysis stuffs such as machine learning, AI, neural networks, data science, blockchain... But there is a wonderful library that is includes wide-mobile programing objects. It's "Kivy and KivyMD". KivyMD is extended material design depends on Kivy.

#Libraries:
-Kivy and KivyMD

-SymPy

-Matplotlib
