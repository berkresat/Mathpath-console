# Mathpath-
Hello, I'll tell you how to make a mathematical solver or scientific stuffs on Python with Kivy-KivyMD libraries that developing mobile application.
I developed Mathpath application that is advanced mathematical solver running on mobile and computer during college year. You can check with type 'Mathpath Console' on Google Play Store.

This page includes a little bit tell about; how I made Mathpath? Which I used libraries and programming language? Just I hope this knowledges helps other students or curious minds.

3- Some errors, bugs and problems. And how may solution these problems

1- A SHORT STORY OF MATHPATH HOW TO BIRTH?

This is a Mathpath. Actually I'm physics student and "one day, when I’m getting symbolic calculating lesson with Maple software, it was fascinated me. That the time, I knew Python language as basic. In a while later my scientific computing feelings was soar. Immediately I created a little group whose have include physics students. I thought this; we have to create a usefull mathematical tools for all students. But most important is we have to spread this “thrive spirit” our classes. But started a pandemic process after the created group just 2 weeks later. But we went on communicate some friends. In the end, I was code my application called “Mathpath Console” before graduation. Now the application published on Google Play Store"
If you are wondering more information please look at my simple blog-site: https://mathpath-sky.blogspot.com/p/about-us.html 

2- PROGRAMMING TO MATHPATH

I used Python language to programming my mathematical application. I know most of people didn't know(or heard) how to programming a mobile application with Python. General belief is coding with Python analysis stuffs such as machine learning, AI, neural networks, data science, blockchain... But there is a wonderful library that is includes wide-mobile programing objects. It's "Kivy and KivyMD". KivyMD is extended material design depends on Kivy. Then as you know, Matplotib and SymPy libraries are famous mathematical libraries.

#Libraries:

-Kivy and KivyMD

-SymPy

-Matplotlib

(Look at top, 'example_interface' for simple interface) <--> this example is explain how to use Kivy for design simple interface. Actually SymPy and Matplotlib are rather wide and strong libraries. Therefore just need to edit these libraries for users pretty-easy experience. 

(Look at top, 'example' for mathematical process) <--> this example is explain how to use SymPy for mathematical subprocess. 

3- SOME ERRORS, BUGS AND PROBLEMS. AND HOW MAY SOLUTION THESE PROBLEMS

Most specific errors during compile with Buildozer, this error, 'mpmath error'. And solution is here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61879229/buildozer-error-install-mpmath-version-0-19 

Also if you have problem in buildozer.spec file 'update library problem' solution is here https://groups.google.com/g/kivy-users/c/u2B-WrT3kPk/m/lZkpCevNAQAJ

Frankly, if you a bug or error about Kivy or during compile, do not hesitate to share message about your problem at Google Groups-Kivy.
But first seek at 'stack over flow' or alike websites.
Then, check Kivy-KivyMD document.

I hope these examples and explations helps your invidual project. You know this project developed for students and also for they use easily tools. Maybe turn on a open source, if there is enough contributors messages.
